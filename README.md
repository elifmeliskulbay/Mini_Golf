### VERSION or DATE: 17.03.2022
### AUTHORS: Antoine Dorard, Julian Zootjes, Elif Melis Kulbay, Shireen Aynetchi, Andra Maglas and Miruna Cotfas

### PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  
Create a putting game in which players aim to strike a ball across a field with obstacles to
have it fall into a target hole.


### HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  
Open the zip file and run the /core/group15/main/Main.java file.
If the above does not work, then running the program using Gradle is required.  
First open the project as a Gradle Project:  
To do so please follow the instructions for your IDE:
 * Eclipse: File -> Import -> Gradle -> Existing Gradle Project
 * IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Open -> Open (and then open as a project)
 * NetBeans: File -> Open Project...
Once the project is opened, find the gradle section or your IDE and run the task named 'run' in the 'other' section.

For Visual Studio Code, more steps are required.  
The following guide describes step by step how to open and run a Gradle Project:

### USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed and gradle inside your main folder.  
Start the game by clicking either player mode or bot mode.
Try to avoid from making the ball fall into the water. You will get penalized for this. Enjoy!
